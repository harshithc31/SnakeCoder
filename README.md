# 🐍 Array Snake Game - ArrayAscent

**ArrayAscent** is a fun and educational twist on the classic Snake game. It visualizes JavaScript array operations (`push`, `splice`, `reverse`, `sort`, `filter`) through interactive gameplay. As the snake eats different types of food, it performs the corresponding array method — allowing players to learn and observe how arrays behave in real-time.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

- 🟥 **Push Food (Red)**: Adds a new segment to the snake's array.
- 🟧 **Splice Food (Orange)**: Removes a random segment from the snake.
- 🟦 **Reverse Food (Blue)**: Reverses the snake's order.
- 🟨 **Sort Food (Yellow)**: Sorts the snake's numbers in ascending order.
- 🟩 **Filter Food (Green)**: Filters out even numbers.

Each snake segment holds a number, so all operations have visible effects on the structure and content of the snake.
